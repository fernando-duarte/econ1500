# UI Component Approach Changes

## Summary of Changes

We've moved from a bulk installation of Radix UI components to an on-demand installation approach using Shadcn UI. This change provides several benefits:

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Only the components and primitives we actually use are included
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: Components are directly in our codebase for easy customization
3. **Better Performance**: Next.js can better tree-shake the code
4. **Consistent Design System**: Shadcn UI provides a cohesive design language

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Removed bulk Radix UI dependencies**:

   - Removed 10 Radix UI packages from package.json that weren't being used
   - These included packages for avatar, dialog, dropdown-menu, etc.

2. **Set up Shadcn UI on-demand approach**:

   - Added components/ui directory for Shadcn UI components
   - Created a demonstration with Button and Card components
   - Added documentation for the new approach

3. **Optimized Next.js configuration**:

   - Updated optimizePackageImports in next.config.ts to include lucide-react
   - This improves tree-shaking for icon components

4. **Added documentation**:
   - Created shadcn-ui-usage.md with detailed guidance
   - Added this change log document

## How to Use the New Approach

When you need a new UI component:

1. Add it with the Shadcn CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add component-name`
2. If prompted, install any required Radix UI primitives
3. Import and use the component in your code: `import { Component } from "@/components/ui/component"`

See the full documentation in [docs/shadcn-ui-usage.md](./shadcn-ui-usage.md).

## Example Implementation

The home page (app/page.tsx) now demonstrates using both Button and Card components from Shadcn UI. This serves as a reference for how to implement components in the future.

## Future Considerations

- As the project grows, consider creating component compositions or patterns for frequently used UI arrangements
- Maintain consistent styling across components by standardizing common properties
- If any additional UI libraries are needed, evaluate them based on bundle size impact and tree-shaking compatibility
